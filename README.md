# Rafael-Project
Project goal:
Classifying rockets to different types using data science algorithms 
and research various types of machine learning methods.

we got a CSV file with data about 16 types of rokets. the data contains a 30 seconds of radar record of about 30000 rockets.
First we had to build a histogram that would visualise the velocity of each type of rocket.
then we start with destinguishing between set of pairs of rockets, for each pair we devide its data to:'training set' and 'test set'.
We started analyzing the data of the 'trainig set' so we would be able to build a model that will learn the featurs of each rocket and than, run on the test set and classify each rocket according to its individual features.
